## Introduction

This repository contains a machine learning solution for predicting product demand. The goal of this project is to help businesses optimize their inventory management by forecasting the demand for their products.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Required Python libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone (https://github.com/Udhayaranikesavan/ADS_Phase1) 
cd product-demand-prediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies (see [Requirements](#requirements)).

3. Download or prepare your dataset and place it in the `data/` directory (see [Data](#data)).

## Usage

### Configuration

Modify the configuration parameters in `config.yaml` according to your dataset and desired settings.

### Data

Prepare your dataset in CSV format and place it in the `data/` directory. Ensure it contains the necessary columns for training and prediction.

### Model Training

To train the demand prediction model, run:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

This script will preprocess the data, train the model, and save it to the `models/` directory.

### Inference

To make predictions using the trained model, run:

```bash
python predict_demand.py
```

This script will load the trained model and generate demand predictions.

## Results

Results and evaluation metrics will be saved to the `results/` directory.

 # Product Demand Prediction with Machine Learning

## Overview
This project aims to predict product demand using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data, the model can forecast demand for products, which can be valuable for inventory management and production planning.

## Dataset
The dataset for this project was sourced from [Kaggle.com]. You can find the dataset at [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chakradharmattapalli/product-demand-prediction-with-machine-learning].The dataset consists of historical records of product demand, with the following key columns:

- `product_id`: Unique product identifier.
- `date`: Date of demand.
- `demand`: The actual demand for the product.

Please ensure that you have downloaded and placed the dataset in the `data/` directory of this project before proceeding.

## Dependencies
Make sure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for exploring data and notebooks)

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone
(https://github.com/Udhayaranikesavan/ADS_Phase1) 
cd product-demand-prediction
Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

bash
Copy code
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: venv\Scripts\activate
Install project-specific dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Start Jupyter Notebook (if not already started):

bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook
Open and run the Jupyter Notebook Product_Demand_Prediction.ipynb. This notebook guides you through data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Model Training
The notebook includes sections for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, and training.
You can modify hyperparameters and experiment with different machine learning algorithms.

## Evaluation
Evaluate your model's performance using appropriate metrics such as RMSE, MAE, or custom business-specific metrics.

## Deployment
Once you have a trained model, you can deploy it in a production environment. Popular options include integrating it into a web application or using cloud-based services for predictions.

## Contributing
If you want to contribute to this project, please follow the standard Git branching and pull request process. We welcome contributions, bug reports, or feature requests.
